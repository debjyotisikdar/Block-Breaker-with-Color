#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
A short remake of Atari's "Breakout" in Unity2D, but with increased difficulty and elements of "bubble shooters". The game is built is written entirely in C# on      Unity2D (manifestly uses NVIDIA PhysX). Each level (6 in total) contains destructible balls of different colors. Accordingly, the player will be provided with multiple sprites or balls of matching colors to destroy all the balls.
